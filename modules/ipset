#
#  This is a more general example of the execute module.
#
#  This one is called "echo".
#
#  Attribute-Name = `%{echo:/path/to/program args}`
#
#  If you wish to execute an external program in more than
#  one section (e.g. 'authorize', 'pre_proxy', etc), then it
#  is probably best to define a different instance of the
#  'exec' module for every section.	
#
#  The return value of the program run determines the result
#  of the exec instance call as follows:
#  (See doc/configurable_failover for details)
#
#  < 0 : fail      the module failed
#  = 0 : ok        the module succeeded
#  = 1 : reject    the module rejected the user
#  = 2 : fail      the module failed
#  = 3 : ok        the module succeeded
#  = 4 : handled   the module has done everything to handle the request
#  = 5 : invalid   the user's configuration entry was invalid
#  = 6 : userlock  the user was locked out
#  = 7 : notfound  the user was not found
#  = 8 : noop      the module did nothing
#  = 9 : updated   the module updated information in the request
#  > 9 : fail      the module failed
#
